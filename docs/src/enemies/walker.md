# Walker

The Walker enemy is the typical “filler” enemy and has these features.

- Movement: Walks slower than the player in their direction. 
- Damage: Deals damage on collision with the player. 
- Health: Moderate amount of health. This type should be cannon fodder. 
- Resistance: No specific resistances.

These enemies should make the player feel a basic level of threat and keep them moving.
