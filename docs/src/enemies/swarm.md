# Swarm


The Swarm enemies are a group of smaller enemies.

-  Movement: Moves as a group from one side of the screen to the other. 
-  Damage: Deals damage on collision with the player.
-  Health: Individual swarm enemies are very squishy. 
-  Resistance: Very easy to knock back. 

An incoming swarm of enemies flying quickly toward the player may create an “oh no” moment, keeping the gameplay dynamic and less predictable. This concept feels like a harder version of Vampire Survivor.
