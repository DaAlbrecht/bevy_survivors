# Jumper


The Jumper enemy is a special type of enemy, which is not as common as the Walker type.

- Movement: Keeps distance from the player and jumps toward them. 
- Damage: Deals damage on impact and creates a zone with a special effect (e.g., slow, poison, fire, etc.).
- Health: Should feel tanky.
- Resistance: No specific resistances.

The player needs to move out of the indicated landing area and avoid stepping into it again. This may lead to tricky situations where the player must choose between walking into the puddle or into approaching enemies.
