What are the key features of enemies, and how do they differ from each other?

 -  Movement: How does the enemy type move?
 -  Damage: How does the enemy type deal damage?
 -  Health: How much health does the enemy type have?
 -  Resistance: Is the enemy type resistant to something?

Each enemy type should make the player behave differently to defeat it. For each enemy type, let's ask ourselves: 

How does the player defeat this enemy type, and how is it different from the other types?

> [!NOTE]  
>Enemies of the same type can still have different stats, such as movement speed, damage, health, and special shots or effects.
>Each enemy type probably needs its own systems for movement, abilities, and damage interactions. 
>How do we want to spawn enemies, and how do we handle different waves? Do we want special enemies like elites or bosses? What rewards should the player get for defeating them?
