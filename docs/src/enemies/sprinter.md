# Sprinter

The Sprinter enemy is a special type of enemy, which is not as common as the Walker type.

-  Movement: Keeps distance from the player and then sprints toward them. 
-  Damage: Deals damage on collision with the player and knocks them back. 
-  Health: Moderate amount of health.
-  Resistance: Becomes “unstoppable” while sprinting.

The player needs to actively dodge this enemy's charge, which may interrupt their planned path and force them to take a new one.
