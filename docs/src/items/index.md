# Items

We want to provide a twist to the simple collection of items with stat improvements known from bullet hell like games. The focus should be more on abilities and weapons. Items provide utility and augmentations to the core gameplay loop.

## Crafting

Besides XP enemies can drop different quality crafting materials. These can be used in the active level(run) to craft items. Crafting an item requires a recipe that defines the required materials and their quality. These are used to craft active weapons into more special variants. To do so the player will need to make his way to a crafting station.

Crafts will also allow to combine different spells into new ones. This will require the player to own specific spells and use them as ingredients for the crafting recipe. Crafts should be a choice between different playstyles.

### Example

- Active Weapon Fireball
- Materials collected 3x power rune (common), 2x fire essence (rare)
- Second owned spell has to be thorn
- Combine craft:
  - a. Fire-Trail Thorn. Enemies get `Burning` effect.
  - b. Burning Thorn Wall.
