# Weapons

What are the key features of weapons, and how do they differ from each other?

| Aspect    | Description                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Targeting | AOE/BUFF/PROJECTILE..         |
| Range     | Melee/Ranged                  |
| Cooldown  | Attack trigger cooldown (sec) |
| Scaling   | What improves how much        |
| Status    | Stun/Slow/Freeze/Charm..      |

Each weapon type should make the player behave differently to use it effectively.  
For each weapon type, let's ask ourselves: _How does this weapon shape the player's movement and strategy, and how is it different from the other types?_

## Types of Weapons

Weapons can be broadly categorized into the following types:

1. **Physical Weapons**: These weapons should be most effective against enemies without armour. `Knockback` is applied.
2. **Elemental Weapons**: These weapons should be most effective against enemies with armour. `StatusEffects` are applied. `Knockback` only when the elemental type is suitable.
