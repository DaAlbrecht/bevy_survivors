# Spells

Spells differ from weapons in that they are active abilities that the player can use. While weapons are primarily focused on dealing damage to enemies, spells can provide a wider range of effects, including area control, buffs, debuffs, and utility.

Design principles for spells should consider the following aspects:

- **Targeting**: Spells can be targeted at specific locations, enemies, or even the player themselves. This allows for strategic placement and timing of spell usage. Spells should require the player to aim or select a target, adding an element of skill.
- **Types**: We use the classic `Q-W-E-R` spell system, where each key corresponds to a different spell type. This allows for quick access and easy memorization of spell functions. Spells can be categorized into offensive, defensive, and utility types.
- **Combos**: Do give spells more impact they can be used to create `Combo` Attacks (First spawn water, then lightning, combine `StatusEffect`...).
