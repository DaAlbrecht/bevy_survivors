# Lore and World Design

## Journey

We play as a journeyman wizard on a quest to increase his reputation with the magicians guild of `TODO`. To do so the player can accept quests from village people in the [village hub](/world/hub.md). Our main character then ventures out leading the player through the different [levels](/levels/index.md).

## Progression

We want an increasing feel of danger based on player progress. To avoid a simple linear progression the journey will lead the player back to previously visited biomes but with new areas unlocked.
